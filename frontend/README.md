**Here, we'll discuss issues that I couldn't (yet) overcome, technologies used, a "User Story" (provided on Trello) and cap it all off with my stretch goals for this app (also provided on Trello). I'll also provide the link to my site, within.**

## Issues I couldn't resolve:

- Staying on the Current Blog page after creating or updating a blog.

- Having the screen re-render to show the updated list of comments after deleting one.

- There is a rapid amount of re-renders when logging-out.

## **Technologies Used**
### Front-End:
- React Router: Used to set up a multi-page-like app.
- React/JSX: A library that combines JavaScript and HTML functionality.
- JavaScript: Used to adapt interactivity to a web page, making it a "web application".
- HTML: The "document" section of a web page. Holds all the document's text.
- CSS: Used to apply styling to the web page document.
- @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object:
-axios:

### Back-End:
- bcrypt:
- cors:
- dotenv:
- express:
- express-async-handler:
- gitignore:
- jsonwebtoken:
- mongoose:

- **HONORABLE MENTIONS**
- JavaScript's "window" reference: Used to get info about what's happening in the browser's current window (like mouse location).
